# moshy

moshy is a datamoshing utility kit for AVI files, based heavily on [aviglitch](https://github.com/ucnv/aviglitch).
It's designed to make common datamoshing tasks easier from a command line interface
without having to open avidemux or other GUI tools. It lets you do stuff like:

- Convert video files into AVI video files with minimal I-Frames and no B-frames for ultimate moshability
- Create P-Frame duplication effects quickly
- Split a long video file into multiple clips based on its I-Frames
- "Bake" your datamoshed video, encoding the corruption as actual video content for uploading to video services or moshing even further!
- Identifying keyframe and deltaframe indexes in any AVI file
- ...and more!
